## 🌌 Branding & Vision

> **"One is All, All is One" (万物归一，一生万物)**
> —— This Zen philosophy is the core essence of **1Agents**. In the next era of AI, we no longer need endless isolated chat windows. Instead, we need a single unified intelligence hub that connects both the digital and physical worlds.

We are standing at a tipping point where **"AI will make everything compatible."** As system CLI tools, legacy applications, and desktop softwares become API-driven through lightweight middleware, AI agents are evolving into the universal adapters connecting all systems and hardware.

**1Agents** is far more than just a remote web terminal; it is an **Open-source Distributed Agent & Multi-device Collaboration Workspace**. It aims to dismantle hardware and location boundaries, allowing you to manage, coordinate, and hand off tasks seamlessly to agents running on heterogeneous host environments via a single browser view:
- **💻 macOS Node**: Serves as your "daily productivity workspace." It natively calls iCloud file synchronization, parses system logs, and runs AppleScript or Apple Shortcuts.
- **🐧 Linux VPS Node**: Acts as your "heavy cloud computing workhorse." Operating 24/7, it manages Docker containers, orchestrates backend tasks, and coordinates long-running server workers.
- **🪟 Windows Node**: Serves as your "specialist operator." It automates legacy, professional desktop software through UI automation and Win32 RPA.
- **🔌 Embedded & IoT Node**: Looking forward, it extends to the edge, reading sensors (GPIO) and sending signals to bring intelligence into physical workflows.

## 🧭 Project Status & Milestone Roadmap

**1Agents** is not a purely theoretical abstract network, but a highly practical, step-by-step developer workbench designed to scale into a decentralized intelligence hub.

### 1. What We Are Today
Today, 1Agents is a **lightweight, zero-configuration, multi-workspace remote Web dashboard** designed for modern developers and AI agents. It features an ultra-responsive web terminal (deeply integrated `ttyd + tmux`), a fully-featured file explorer with HTML/PDF high-definition preview, native Speech-to-Text, auto-generated SSL certificates, Tailscale Green Lock, and the CC-Connect chat bridge. It perfectly hosts, manages, and shields your local AI tooling workflow (such as `Claude Code`, `Codex CLI`, `OpenClaw`, etc.).

### 2. Next Major Milestone: 1Agents Distributed Orchestrator
Our next immediate focus is the **1Agents Distributed Task & Resource Orchestration Hub (Orchestration Hub)**. Rather than just a communication protocol, this is a complete workspace that implements the **"User Request ➡️ Intent Analysis ➡️ Multi-device Orchestration ➡️ Distributed Execution ➡️ Unified Synthesis & Feedback"** loop:

- **👤 User Intent Capture**: The user submits high-level goals or creative ideas through the Unified Portal (Web Browser / PWA / App).
- **📋 Task Orchestration**: The Orchestrator leverages LLMs to break down complex goals into structured, multi-step sub-tasks and dependency execution flows.
- **🧩 Resource & Agent Orchestration**: The Orchestrator queries available online nodes (macOS, Linux VPS, Windows) and matches sub-tasks to the best node based on their **heterogeneous host native capabilities** (e.g., dispatching file extraction to a macOS node, web deployment to a Linux node, or legacy app automation to a Windows node).
- **🛡️ Validation & Handoff**: Distributed nodes execute sub-tasks locally and stream output back. The Orchestrator verifies the deliverables, compiles the final result, and returns it to the user.

## 💡 Advanced Setup & Guides

### 1. Configure LAN/WAN Let's Encrypt (Tailscale Setup)

Modern browsers enforce a **Secure Context** (requiring `localhost` or `HTTPS`) to access media device APIs (like Microphone for Speech-to-Text), Clipboard, or Service Workers. 

The easiest and safest way to obtain a valid HTTPS certificate on your private network is using **Tailscale**:

1. **Activate HTTPS Certs**: Enable **HTTPS Certificates** in your Tailscale Admin Console.
2. **Download Tailscale Certs**: In your host node terminal, execute:
   ```bash
   tailscale cert <your-tailscale-node-domain.ts.net>
   ```
3. **Move to Certs folder**: Place the output `.crt` and `.key` files inside `~/.1agents/certs/`.
4. **Boot with SSL**: Simply execute:
   ```bash
   1agents --ssl
   ```
   *The Go daemon automatically indexes and links the Tailscale certificate. You will get the green secure padlock 🔒 from any authorized phone or laptop on your Tailscale tailnet!*
   *(For details, read: [Tailscale Certificate Setup Guide](docs/tips/ssl-certificate-guide.md))*

### 2. Speech-to-Text Microphone Permissions & Troubleshooting

- **Safari (macOS) is Highly Recommended**: Safari uses macOS native offline speech transcription. It is **incredibly fast, works entirely offline without network delay, and is highly accurate**.
- **Chrome / Edge Network Errors**: Chrome/Edge relies on Google Cloud API for Web Speech transcriptions. If you run in isolated private networks or have firewall configurations, you will see `Speech recognition error: network`.
- **Mobile Access**: Speech-to-Text requires active HTTPS/SSL on mobile devices to gain microphone access.
- *(For details, read: [Speech Recognition Compatibility Notes](docs/tips/voice-recognition.md))*

### 3. Zero-Config Tunnels (Cloudflare & CC-Connect)

When running in restricted environments with no public IP or firewall access (like home routers, corporate internal networks, or public cafe Wi-Fi), `1Agents` offers a dead-simple public tunnel:

#### 💡 Behind the scenes & First Download Experience
Booting with the `-tunnel` flag:
```bash
1agents -tunnel
```
System automatically triggers the tunnel workflow:
1. **Intelligent Path Discovery**: Checks if `cloudflared` is already installed in the path (e.g., via Homebrew on macOS or `apt` on Linux). If found, it **instantly boots in 0.1 seconds, skipping downloads**.
2. **On-Demand Secure Download**: If missing, Go downloads it (~30MB) from the official GitHub Release page. **Real-time percentages and progress bars** are logged to the console.
   - *High-speed Broadband*: Takes **2 ~ 5 seconds** and prints the QR code.
   - *Restricted Network*: Taking roughly **15 ~ 30 seconds**.
   - *Subsequent Launches*: Launches in **0.1 seconds** using the local cached binary.
3. **Secure Mobile Connect**: Prints a high-contrast QR code directly in the terminal, allowing any scanned mobile device to safely tunnel into your console.

#### 🤖 CC-Connect Chat Activation
If you have [cc-connect](https://github.com/scottzx/cc-connect) active, you don't even need terminal access. **Just ping your custom Feishu, Slack, or Telegram chatbot with "Launch my workspace" or "Start tunnel", and the backend automatically pulls up the tunnel and replies with a secure, temporary HTTPS link.**
